	<h1>Shiba Inu:</h1>
<br>
<h1>Information chuchu~</h1>
<br>
Looking at the Shiba Inu, you can definitely see that they are cute and would even remind you of foxes with the nose and ears. They weight aroung 17- 23 lbs (7.71kg - 10.43kg), at the shoulder they're can be as tall as 13-17 inches in height (1.03ft - 1.41ft), making these dogs pretty small and light. The Shiba Inu is also part of the Breed Group of Companion Dogs and will ensure you 12-16yrs of pure bliss. Their fur color can range from an orange-brown, dark brown, black, and white. The breed is quite intelligent, though stubborn, it is also known for their bold, fiery, and athletic personality.
<br>
<h1>History or fun facts chuchu~</h1>
<br>
The Japanese describe the breed to have 'soboku' (alertness), 'ryosei' (good nature), 'kaani-i' (spirited boldness), and all of these pertaining to mentality of this breed. Before, these dogs were used as a hunting dog for small critters and birds, which leads to the possible theory on how they got the name "Shiba Inu". Supposedly, Shiba when translated would mean "brushwood" which were the bushes where they often hunted in, though there are other theories to how the dog got its name. 
<br>
Sadly, this orange fluffy boy would lose many of its breed due to World War II and the many bombing raids, fires, and other destructive events. Other than the World War, they'd also be infected with distemper, a deadly virus for dogs that affects teh brain's cells, skin, mucus membranes, and the gastronintestinal tract, causing many more to die in the post-war years. These two factors would cause Siba Inu's to be brought over from the countryside or areas that were not afected nor infected to help breed the dogs, although causing almost all of modern day's shiba Inu's to be inbred. 
<br>
THE DOGE IS A SHIBA INU BY THE WAY !!

	<h1>Pomeranian:</h1>
<br>
<h1>Information chuchu~</h1>
<br>
A Pomeranian is a little fluff ball, weighing around 3-7 lbs (1.36kg - 3.17kg) and reaching the height of 7-12 inches tall (0.58ft - 1ft). Though the fluff balls don't last forever, sadly, only living to 12 up to 16 years on average. But as a companion dog, it will keep those years as lively as ever. These dogs are intelligent but perhaps in-over their heads as they can be bold but too much and they might start to provoke larger dogs. Picking fights yet still being a fluff seems like the Pomeranian's style. Varieties of the Poms can go from red, orange, white, cream, blue, brown, and black, although the fur can still be a mix.
<br>
<h1>History or fun facts chuchu~</h1>
<br>
Named after the province in Pomerania, Germany. During a confirmation show, Queen Victoria showed off her Pomeranians to the audience and thus making them become very popular. 
<br>
Pomeranian nicknames and abbreviations include: Pom, Pom-Pom, Fluff, Floof, Fluff Ball

	<h1>Corgi:</h1>
<br>
<h1>Information chuchu~</h1>
<br>
Corgis are as tall as 10-12 inches(0.83ft - 1ft) but weigh up to 30 lbs (13.60), so you better start lifting corgis instead of whatever weights you have. Unlike the two other dogs before this, this is a Herding dog which were meant to herd and watch over the sheep during ye olden times. These corgis would be able to herd and chase the sheep to their heart's content for around 12-14 years and they'd do it well. Their coats can be red, sable, fawn or be red, black and tan all at once. White being placed on their legs, chest, neck, muzzle, and belly. 
<br>
<h1>History or fun facts chuchu~</h1>
<br>
The most famous celebrity to have corgis as pets is no other than the Queen, which were originally was a gift that has now turned into a family tree of corgis. There are 2 types of Welsh Corgis, the Pembroke and the Cardigan, which were only separated into two different breeds in 1934 by the Kennel Club. To tell the difference is to look at the tails, "Pembroke has a 'broke' tail; the Cardigan has a long tail like the sleeves of a cardigan sweater". 
<br>
Try Guessing the kind of corgi is in the picture! (Hint: it's the same one as what the Queen has.)

	<h1>Pugs:</h1>
<br>
<h1>Information chuchu~</h1>
<br>
The last, but certainly not the least, companion dog of this list, and the pug will be here for you and forever or at least 12-15 years. Being 10-14 inches in height (0.83ft-1.17ft) and weighing 14-18 lbs (6.35kg - 8.16kg). Id you don't already see it, a pugs face is filled with wrinkles and its face is covered with them while also being predominantly dark. Another signature feature of the dog is the little curl on its butt that it calls its tail. These dogs are small and quiet, yet still smart and stubborn like many other dogs. Pugs are emotional animals, the two emotions being very playful and ready for games, but also loving and caring for they need to be the center of attention and must be close to their owners. 
<br>
<h1>History and fun facts chuchu~</h1>
<br>
The Pug comes from the Latin word, "fist" as it resembles a human fist and not because it's face looks like it got smushed by one. A pugs cheecks would be called "beauty spots". Supposedly the Chinese who were masters in dog breeding, admired the wrinkles as to be good luck. The wrinkles being able to resemble those good luck symbols in their writing, and dogs that could form the word, "prince", would be even more prized.
<br>
Though these pugs are cute, I believe that many of these should be cross-bred with other dogs. These dogs were inbred for many generations in order to keep the breed pure, causing such distinct wrinkles in their face as a by-product. But the same wrinkles cause problems for their breathing and could get even worse with the coming years and generations...
